## Installing Tensorflow with GPU Support for Fast Training

To install TensorFlow with GPU support in an Anaconda environment in 2024, follow these steps:

### Create and Activate Anaconda Environment

First, create a new Anaconda environment and activate it by going to the Anaconda Prompt and running the following commands:

```bash
conda create --name tf_gpu python=3.9
conda activate tf_gpu
```

### Install CUDA and cuDNN

Install the CUDA Toolkit and cuDNN library using Conda:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0
```

### Install TensorFlow

Upgrade pip and install TensorFlow:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install "tensorflow<2.11"
```

*Note: As of 2024, versions above 2.10 are not officially supported for GPU on Windows native installations.*

### Verify the Installation

To verify that TensorFlow can access your GPU:

```bash
python -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"
```

If a list of GPU devices is returned, you've successfully installed TensorFlow with GPU support.
